# BaseCMS

This is a PHP content management system and lightweight framework. The main goal is to try to build something that utilizes PHP as it works in practice, allowing for built-in templating features and a file structure that loosely reflects the structure of the site itself (arguing about whether these are strengths or weaknesses being left as an exercise for the reader).
