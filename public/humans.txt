Much of the boilerplate included in BaseCMS is taken directly from (or, less 
often, inspired by) the work of the HTML5 Boilerplate project. 
See http://html5boilerplate.com/ for their excellent work.

By default, BaseCMS includes the following resources:

    The jQuery JavaScript library - http://jquery.com/
    Components from jQuuery UI - http://jqueryui.com/
    The nestedSortable plugin for jQuery UI by Manuele J Sarfatti - http://mjsarfatti.com/
